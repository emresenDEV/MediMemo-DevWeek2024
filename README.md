# MediMemo-DevWeek2024

 This application is currently in development. Our goal is to create a health app that prevents the loss of patient data during data entry due to network loss and seamlessly updates patient files once the connection is restored.

## Anticipated Features:
- Scheduling Tool
- Data Entry Tool
- Patient History Viewer
- Provider Locator

## Running the Program

### First Time

    - must have node.js installed
    - terminal command:
        - cd client && npm install && npm start

### Future Times

    - terminal command:
        - cd client && npm start

## Instructions for Using Pipenv

- pip install pipenv (installs pipenv to your machine)
- pipenv shell (creates a virtual environment for your project)
- pipenv install (installs packages from our pipfile to your machine)
