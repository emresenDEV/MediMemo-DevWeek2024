# MediMemo-DevWeek2024

This application is a team submission for the DeveloperWeek2024 Hackathon. Our goal is to create a health app that emphasizes the ability to securely cache patient data offline and seamlessly update patient files once the connection is restored.

### Running the Frontend

- First Time: cd client && npm install && npm start
- Future Times: cd client && npm start
